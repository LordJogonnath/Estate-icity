A real estate management app that lets users choose popular locations to deal in real estate, and directing them to corresponding sites where they can accomplish their ventures. I have used magicbricks.com.

Features:
1. Users can sign up, log in using registered passwords and usernames.
2. Users can update passwords and username at their will.
3. Users can choose to buy, rent, sell or lease property in cities that can chosen from a menu, and upon clicking the button for the city, they are directed to magicbricks.com for dealing in that city.

Construction:
1. Used Java (Netbeans IDE) and SQL (MySQL Workbench).
2. GUI was made using JFrame forms, and frontend code was written in Java.
